## Overview

Apache Ignite multi-tier storage implements a cutting-edge storage architecture that combines performance benefits of memory with the scalability and durability advantages of disk-based databases.

## Primary Multi-Tier Storage Usage Modes

### In-Memory Mode

Get all the benefits of in-memory computing solutions. Store and process data at the lowest latency and highest throughput.

#### How It Works

The whole data set is available in memory tier only.

In order to survive node failures, we recommend keeping at least one backup copy of the data in the cluster. DRAM or Intel® Optane™ operating in the Memory Mode can be used as a storage device.

#### Use-Cases

- In-memory caching
- High-performance computing
- Web-session caching
- Real-time processing of continuous data streams

#### In-Memory Mode Case-Study

Watch how Raiffeisen Bank uses in-memory mode to store their data:

### In-Memory + External Database Mode

Accelerate and offload your existing databases by deploying Ignite as a caching layer on top of existing disk-based databases and back-end systems.

#### How It Works

Ignite slides in between your existing application and data layer. Ignite [writes-through](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/persistence/external-storage#read-through-and-write-through) or [writes-behind](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/persistence/external-storage#write-behind-caching) all data modifications to the underlying external databases.

#### Use-Cases

Offloading and acceleration of existing databases, backend-systems, applications and APIs.

#### In-Memory + External Database Mode Case-Study

Watch how ING transformed their core banking system with Apache Ignite:

### Multi-Tier Database Mode

Scale beyond the available memory capacity and skip memory warm-ups on restarts.

#### How It Works

100% of data is persisted to Ignite native persistence, and the same amount or less is cached in memory. The more data cached, the faster the performance.

Applications can query both in-memory and disk-only records transparently scaling beyond available memory capacity.

There is no need for memory warm-ups on restarts since Ignite can serve data from disk. SSD, Flash, HDD or Intel® Optane™ operating in the AppDirect Mode can be used as a storage device.

#### Use-Cases

Ignite as a distributed database for HTAP workloads or digital integration hub with the active persistence layer.

#### Native Persistence Case-Study
