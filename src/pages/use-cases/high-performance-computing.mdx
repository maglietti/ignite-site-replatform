## High-Performance Computing Overview

### What is high-performance computing?

High-performance computing is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at high speeds.

You keep all your data on the cluster node and execute your kilobyte-size custom code over petabytes of data, avoiding network-like utilization.

### How it works

**In traditional disk-based systems, such as relational or NoSQL databases:**

Client applications usually bring data from servers, use the records for local calculations, and discard the data as soon as the business task is completed.

This approach does not scale well if a significant volume of data gets transferred over the network.

**In in-memory computing systems, such as Apache Ignite:**

Apache Ignite supports a co-located processing technique. The primary aim of this technique is to increase the performance of your data-intensive or compute-intensive calculations by running them straight on Ignite cluster nodes.

In co-located processing, calculations are done on local data sets of the cluster nodes. This avoids records shuffling over the network and eliminates the impact of network latency on the performance of your applications.

## Benefits Of Apache Ignite Compute APIs

<div className={styles.benefitsGrid}>
  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Broadcast or execute on specific nodes</h3>
    <p>Broadcast your tasks to use all the CPUs of your distributed cluster.</p>
    <p>Or execute your computations on a specific group of nodes.</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Load balance your queries</h3>
    <p>If some of the nodes are over-utilized, Ignite can load balance your calculations to the other node.</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>All computations are fault-tolerant</h3>
    <p>Some computations might take minutes or hours to complete, e.g. drug discovery or logistics planning. You don't need to start from the very beginning if something goes wrong.</p>
  </div>
</div>
