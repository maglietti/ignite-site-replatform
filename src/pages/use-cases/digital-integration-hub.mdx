## Digital Integration Hub Overview

### What is a digital integration hub?

A digital integration hub (DIH) is an advanced platform architecture that aggregates multiple back-end systems and databases into a low-latency and shared data store.

The store caches and persists data sets scattered across many disjointed back-end databases and makes them available to your applications through high-performance APIs.

### How digital integration hub works

Applications access Ignite via an API service layer and experience substantial performance improvements by requesting data from only the Ignite distributed store.

## Benefits Of Using Apache Ignite as a Digital Integration Hub

<div className={styles.benefitsGrid}>
  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Advanced architecture that aggregates data from multiple back-end data sources</h3>
    <p>No need to clutter the applications with logic accessing numerous data stores.</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Unified data access layer for new types of applications and services</h3>
    <p>Have applications accessing a single low-latency store for hybrid operations.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Digital Integration Hub Synchronization Techniques

Ignite, as a high-performance data store, can be synchronized with the back-end databases via:

- Streaming
- Event-based
- Change data capture (CDC)
- And other techniques

<div className={styles.twoColumnLayout}>
  <div>
    <p><strong>For uni-directional synchronization</strong> between an Ignite cluster and an external store, Ignite provides the CacheStore interface.</p>
    <p>This interface allows Ignite to write-through or write-behind all the changes to the backend-systems automatically.</p>
    <p>It also includes transactions. Ignite coordinates and commits a transaction across its in-memory cluster as well as an external transactional database.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p><strong>For bi-directional synchronization,</strong> you can consider various streaming, CDC, and event-based technologies, such as: Kafka, Spark, Debezium and others.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Why Do Businesses Need Digital Integration Hub Solutions?

To create new types of applications that can query data from disperse data sources.

DIH is a contemporary way to complete this challenging task.

<div className={styles.benefitsGrid}>
  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>01</h3>
    <p>Accumulate data from dozens of data sources</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>02</h3>
    <p>Keep data in a shared and low-latency store</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>03</h3>
    <p>Get data synchronized with back-end systems</p>
  </div>
</div>
