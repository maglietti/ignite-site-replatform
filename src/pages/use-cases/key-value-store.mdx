## What is a Key-Value Store?

A key-value store is a data storage software. It stores, retrieves, and manages data as a set of unique keys. Each one is associated with one and only one value.

### How a Key-Value Store Works

A key-value store, or a key-value database, holds a collection of data records in various fields. The data records have unique keys to retrieve and modify records quickly.

  <img src="/img/usecases/key-value/image.svg" alt="Key-value store architecture" />
</div>

## Benefits Of Key-Value Store

<div className={styles.benefitsGrid}>
  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Low-latency access and high-performance</h3>
    <p>Thanks to their design, key-value stores can perform many more operations in a given amount of time than other database models</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.benefitItem}>
    <h3>Horizontal scalability</h3>
    <p>Key-value stores can keep and process large volumes of data by scaling horizontally</p>
  </div>
</div>

## With Apache Ignite, a Key-Value Store Can Cache Data in Memory and Persist it on Disk

The [native persistence](/architecture/native-persistence) feature eliminates the time-consuming cache warm-up step as well as the data reloading phase from external databases.

Since native persistence always keeps a full copy of data on disk, you are free to cache a subset of records in memory.

If a required data record is missing in memory, then Ignite reads it from disk automatically, regardless of the API you use.

## Key-Value Store is Used When **Speed and Scale are Top Priorities**

<div className={styles.useCaseGrid}>
  <div className={styles.useCaseItem}>
    <h3>User sessions caching</h3>
    <p>Key-value stores are used to accumulate user session details in web applications to personalize content.</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.useCaseItem}>
    <h3>360 Customer View</h3>
    <p>Applications can collect user preferences and behavioral patterns to offer better services. The records can be stored in a key-value database to enable fast customer data lookups.</p>
  </div>

  <div className={styles.useCaseItem}>
    <h3>Back-end systems acceleration</h3>
    <p>Developers use key-value stores to cache specific records that don't require a regular update. This reduces the load on core back-end systems and databases.</p>
  </div>
</div>
